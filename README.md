# Enchants Ahoy
Greetings! This is a minecraft datapack that adds custom enchantments.
These range from passive health-recovery enchantments up to active ground pounds!
It's still a W.I.P. My main objective is to have at least 15'ish enchantments before ending support.
But even when I do end support, who knows? I might get bored and add some more.

Also, currently, some enchantments don't to work with vanilla enchantments. My bad for that. Might fix it, might not, who knows?

## Current enchantments (5/15)
These are listed in alphabetical order.

### Ghost Strike:

This curse, supported by shields and totems, removes your ability to deal damage while they're on your offhand. Perfect to get a slight advantage against your oponents. Just enchant their shield with this and watch their confusion upon the sudden realisation that you are invincible to their hits! Until, of course, they get their shield off.

### Ground Pound:

This enchantment, supported by boots, makes it so whenever you jump, you get a very high jump. However, after half a second, you freeze midair and then quickly fall to the ground, [^1] dealing area damage up to 5 blocks!

### Health Siphon: 

This enchantment, supported by weapons, such as swords, axes, bows and crossbows, lets you get some of your health back whenever hitting any[^2] entity!

### Hover Step: [^3]

(Currently) the only 3-level enchantment, and supported by all boots, allows you to be up to 5 seconds[^4] floating in air, by setting your attribute "gravity" 's base to 0. Also plays a particle effect based on the time you have remaining.

### Curse of Recoil:

This curse makes it so, whenever you hit an entity, you get damaged back. Kind of like reverse-thorns.
